## Requirements :white_check_mark:
### .txt Answers
* All your files should end with a new line
* If the answer ends in a decimal, round it to the nearest hundredth
* Vectors and matrices should be formatted with parentheses and commas as shown below:
Vector:
(0, 0.03)
Matrix:
(1, 0, -7.64)
(-9.41, -0.23, 7)
### C# Projects
* Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your Github and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
* You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
* In the following tasks, there are no main files. For each C# task, you can use the variables in the related task prior to it to create your own main files for testing
* All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
* All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
* You are not allowed to use the Vector or Matrix classes in this project
* You can use the Math class in this project
* If the task’s return value can end in a decimal, round it to the nearest hundredth
## More Info
This project uses radians instead of degrees
